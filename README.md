# Spotify Clone / Music App

This project is a clone of a [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWvlOU2Y3Ik) by @RivaanRanawat, created to help me learn new technologies and development practices. The aim is to replicate the functionality and design of the original video as closely as possible while incorporating new skills and techniques.

## Skills Acquired

During the development of this project, I learned the following technologies and techniques:

 - Riverpod Generators: Used for state management in Flutter.

 - Backend Development with FastAPI: Set up a backend service to handle API requests and responses.

- Connecting to APIs: Integrated the frontend with backend APIs to fetch and display data.

- Basics of PostgreSQL: Gained foundational knowledge in PostgreSQL for database management.

- MVVM Architecture: Implemented Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architecture for better separation of concerns and more manageable code.

- Feature-Wise Development: Applied feature-wise development practices to structure the project modularly and maintainably.

- Basics of Hive Package: Utilized the Hive package for local storage to manage and persist data on the device.
